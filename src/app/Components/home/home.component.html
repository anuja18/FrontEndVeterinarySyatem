                    Cats are nearsighted, but their peripheral vision and night vision are much better than that of
                    humans.
                    <br>
                    Cats are supposed to have 18 toes (five toes on each front paw; four toes on each back paw).
                    <br>
                    Cats have 230 bones, while humans only have 206.<br>
                    Some cats are ambidextrous, but 40 percent are either left- or right-pawed
